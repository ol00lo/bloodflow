	abstract = {Summary Hæmodynamical simulations using one-dimensional (1D) computational models exhibit many of the features of the systemic circulation under normal and diseased conditions. Recent interest in verifying 1D numerical schemes has led to the development of alternative experimental setups and the use of three-dimensional numerical models to acquire data not easily measured in vivo. In most studies to date, only one particular 1D scheme is tested. In this paper, we present a systematic comparison of six commonly used numerical schemes for 1D blood flow modelling: discontinuous Galerkin, locally conservative Galerkin, Galerkin least-squares finite element method, finite volume method, finite difference MacCormack method and a simplified trapezium rule method. Comparisons are made in a series of six benchmark test cases with an increasing degree of complexity. The accuracy of the numerical schemes is assessed by comparison with theoretical results, three-dimensional numerical data in compatible domains with distensible walls or experimental data in a network of silicone tubes. Results show a good agreement among all numerical schemes and their ability to capture the main features of pressure, flow and area waveforms in large arteries. All the information used in this study, including the input data for all benchmark cases, experimental data where available and numerical solutions for each scheme, is made publicly available online, providing a comprehensive reference data set to support the development of 1D models and numerical schemes.

    abstract = {The present study introduces the concept of a newly designed scanning viscometer with a capillary tube for use in measuring whole blood viscosity without the use of anticoagulants in a clinical setting. Both flow rate and pressure drop measurements that are usually required for the operation of a capillary tube viscometer are replaced with a single measurement of liquid-height variation with time. In addition, the present method overcomes the drawbacks of conventional viscometers in the measurement of the whole blood viscosity. First, with the present study, whole blood viscosity can be accurately and consistently measured at 37°C over a wide shear rate range including shear rates as low as 1s−1. Second, the present method can measure whole blood viscosity over a range of shear rates in less than 2min without any anticoagulants so that one can measure the viscosity for unadulterated blood.}

    Abstract = {In this paper, we develop a theory for viscoelastic behavior of large membrane deformations and apply the analysis to the relaxation of projections produced by small micropipette aspiration of red cell discocytes. We show that this relaxation is dominated by the membrane viscosity and that the cytoplasmic and extracellular fluid flow have negligible influence on the relaxation time and can be neglected. From preliminary data, we estimate the total membrane "viscosity" when the membrane material behaves in an elastic solid manner. The total membrane viscosity is calculated to be 10(-3) dyn-s/cm, which is a surface viscosity that is about three orders of magnitude greater than the surface viscosity of lipid membrane components (as determined by "fluidity" measurements). It is apparent that the lipid bilayer contributes little to the fluid dynamic behavior of the whole plasma membrane and that a structural matrix dominates the viscous dissipation. However, we show that viscous flow in the membrane is not responsible for the temporal dependence of the isotropic membrane tension required to produce lysis and that the previous estimates of Rand, Katchalsky, et al., for "viscosity" are six to eight orders of magnitude too large.},

    abstract  ={The yield stress of many yield stress fluids has turned out to be difficult to determine experimentally. This has led to various discussions in the literature about those experimental difficulties{,} and the usefulness and pertinence of the concept of yield stress fluids. We argue here that most of the difficulties disappear when taking the thixotropy of yield stress fluids into account{,} and will demonstrate an experimental protocol that allows reproducible data to be obtained for the critical stress necessary for flow of these fluids. As a bonus{,} we will show that the interplay of yield stress and thixotropy allows one to account for the ubiquitous shear localization observed in these materials. However{,} due to the thixotropy the yield stress is no longer a material property{,} since it depends on the (shear) history of the sample.}

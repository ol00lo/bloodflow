	abstract = {Summary Hæmodynamical simulations using one-dimensional (1D) computational models exhibit many of the features of the systemic circulation under normal and diseased conditions. Recent interest in verifying 1D numerical schemes has led to the development of alternative experimental setups and the use of three-dimensional numerical models to acquire data not easily measured in vivo. In most studies to date, only one particular 1D scheme is tested. In this paper, we present a systematic comparison of six commonly used numerical schemes for 1D blood flow modelling: discontinuous Galerkin, locally conservative Galerkin, Galerkin least-squares finite element method, finite volume method, finite difference MacCormack method and a simplified trapezium rule method. Comparisons are made in a series of six benchmark test cases with an increasing degree of complexity. The accuracy of the numerical schemes is assessed by comparison with theoretical results, three-dimensional numerical data in compatible domains with distensible walls or experimental data in a network of silicone tubes. Results show a good agreement among all numerical schemes and their ability to capture the main features of pressure, flow and area waveforms in large arteries. All the information used in this study, including the input data for all benchmark cases, experimental data where available and numerical solutions for each scheme, is made publicly available online, providing a comprehensive reference data set to support the development of 1D models and numerical schemes.

    abstract = {The present study introduces the concept of a newly designed scanning viscometer with a capillary tube for use in measuring whole blood viscosity without the use of anticoagulants in a clinical setting. Both flow rate and pressure drop measurements that are usually required for the operation of a capillary tube viscometer are replaced with a single measurement of liquid-height variation with time. In addition, the present method overcomes the drawbacks of conventional viscometers in the measurement of the whole blood viscosity. First, with the present study, whole blood viscosity can be accurately and consistently measured at 37°C over a wide shear rate range including shear rates as low as 1s−1. Second, the present method can measure whole blood viscosity over a range of shear rates in less than 2min without any anticoagulants so that one can measure the viscosity for unadulterated blood.}

    Abstract = {In this paper, we develop a theory for viscoelastic behavior of large membrane deformations and apply the analysis to the relaxation of projections produced by small micropipette aspiration of red cell discocytes. We show that this relaxation is dominated by the membrane viscosity and that the cytoplasmic and extracellular fluid flow have negligible influence on the relaxation time and can be neglected. From preliminary data, we estimate the total membrane "viscosity" when the membrane material behaves in an elastic solid manner. The total membrane viscosity is calculated to be 10(-3) dyn-s/cm, which is a surface viscosity that is about three orders of magnitude greater than the surface viscosity of lipid membrane components (as determined by "fluidity" measurements). It is apparent that the lipid bilayer contributes little to the fluid dynamic behavior of the whole plasma membrane and that a structural matrix dominates the viscous dissipation. However, we show that viscous flow in the membrane is not responsible for the temporal dependence of the isotropic membrane tension required to produce lysis and that the previous estimates of Rand, Katchalsky, et al., for "viscosity" are six to eight orders of magnitude too large.},

We argue here that most of the difficulties disappear when taking the thixotropy of yield stress fluids into account{,} and will demonstrate an experimental protocol that allows reproducible data to be obtained for the critical stress necessary for flow of these fluids. As a bonus{,} we will show that the interplay of yield stress and thixotropy allows one to account for the ubiquitous shear localization observed in these materials. However{,} due to the thixotropy the yield stress is no longer a material property{,} since it depends on the (shear) history of the sample.}

abstract = {Reduced models of human arterial networks are an efficient approach to analyze quantitative macroscopic features of human arterial flows. The justification for such models typically arise due to the significantly long wavelength associated with the system in comparison to the lengths of arteries in the networks. Although these types of models have been employed extensively and many issues associated with their implementations have been widely researched, the issue of data uncertainty has received comparatively little attention. Similar to many biological systems, a large amount of uncertainty exists in the value of the parameters associated with the models. Clearly reliable assessment of the system behaviour cannot be made unless the effect of such data uncertainty is quantified. In this paper we present a study of parametric data uncertainty in reduced modelling of human arterial networks which is governed by a hyperbolic system. The uncertain parameters are modelled as random variables and the governing equations for the arterial network therefore become stochastic. This type stochastic hyperbolic systems have not been previously systematically studied due to the difficulties introduced by the uncertainty such as a potential change in the mathematical character of the system and imposing boundary conditions. We demonstrate how the application of a high-order stochastic collocation method based on the generalized polynomial chaos expansion, combined with a discontinuous Galerkin spectral/hp element discretization in physical space, can successfully simulate this type of hyperbolic system subject to uncertain inputs with bounds. Building upon a numerical study of propagation of uncertainty and sensitivity in a simplified model with a single bifurcation, a systematical parameter sensitivity analysis is conducted on the wave dynamics in a multiple bifurcating human arterial network. Using the physical understanding of the dynamics of pulse waves in these types of networks we are able to provide an insight into the results of the stochastic simulations, thereby demonstrating the effects of uncertainty in physiologically accurate human arterial networks.}

    abstract = { An efficient finite difference model of blood flow through the coronary vessels is developed and applied to a geometric model of the largest six generations of the coronary arterial network. By constraining the form of the velocity profile across the vessel radius, the three-dimensional Navier--Stokes equations are reduced to one-dimensional equations governing conservation of mass and momentum. These equations are coupled to a pressure-radius relationship characterizing the elasticity of the vessel wall to describe the transient blood flow through a vessel segment. The two step Lax--Wendroff finite difference method is used to numerically solve these equations. The flow through bifurcations, where three vessel segments join, is governed by the equations of conservation of mass and momentum. The solution to these simultaneous equations is calculated using the multidimensional Newton--Raphson method. Simulations of blood flow through a geometric model of the coronary network are presented demonstrating physiologically realistic flow rates, washout curves, and pressure distributions. }

abstract = {The dissipative particle dynamics method is an efficient method for studying the hydrodynamics of complex fluids. One of the most challenging aspects of this method appears when the solid walls exist. The solid walls disturb the homogeneity of the fluid near the wall and cause some spurious fluctuations. Thus, in recent years a large amount of effort has been devoted to solve this shortcoming. Fortunately the mentioned problem has almost been solved for the simple walls such as flat walls, circular cylinders, spheres, etc. However no systematic model has addressed the complex walls. It should be noted that almost all of the walls we deal with in practical problems such as MEMS devices, polymer and drug containers and so on have complex geometries. In the present paper, we present a systematic method for the dissipative particle dynamics simulation of complex walls based on the representation of the complex wall by means of a triangular grid. We demonstrate the validity of our model for the flow past over a circular cylinder and then we do a simulation for the flow over an airfoil. The obtained results show that this method facilitates the simulation of each arbitrary complex wall while the spurious fluctuations of density and temperature are diminished effectively near the wall.}
